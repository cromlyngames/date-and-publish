\section{Character sheet - Moves}

If you do something in story that triggers a move: \emph{Roll 2d6 + your score + any bonuses.} 
Generally a total below 7 means a frustration, 7-9 is a complicated success and 10+ is a great success.
Start with +2 in \emph{Learn from experience} and +1 in three moves of your choice. Mark experience when you fail a roll.

\section{Start of session}
At the start of each session spend 1-2 career to keep things ticking over. If you cannot, or will not, tell the GM.
%You can earn 3 career on a gig, and odd amounts elsewhere. A gig is a big idea/push or initiative. If you want to start an appropriate gig, talk to the GM
%A new character starts with 2 career.

\section{Draw on the past}
Once per session, when faced with a situation in the present that your past equips you for; establish the stakes and roll.
On a 10+ choose 2 relevant options. On a 7-9 choose 1: \\
+ your instincts are honed. +1 forward to the next relevant roll (add it to the total)\\
+ A new and deeper understanding for you both. +1 to a relationship on yours and their sheets (if applicable)\\
+ establish a key resource you have access to (grandmother's vintage wardrobe, parent's car ect)\\
+ establish a new connection you have access to (old friend in area, gym buddy at fashion house ect)

A failed roll might be you getting immobilised in past emotions(grief); nonchalant (can't borrow car, parents on road trip) or played for comedy (I once slept with a pilot! He let me wear his hat!). It is important to establish the stakes before making the roll.

\section{Lean in}
When you help another player's person via a pep talk, wise counsel, or physical presence; roll + their connection to you. Strained connections count as 0, but can can still be rolled.
This means that if Amy has a 3+ connection to Balin, when Balin \emph{Leans in}, Balin rolls 2 dice + 3. \\
On a 10+ the person you are helping take +1 forward to their roll\\
On a 7-9 they take +1 forward, but you are entangled and will be caught up in any consequences. \\
On a failure, their relationship to you becomes strained.\\
 
\section{Read the vibes}
When you read the vibes, roll. 
On a 10+ ask three questions on the list. On a 7-9 ask 2 questions and answer 2.\\
+ Who is in control here?//
+ What does that person desire?//
+ Who is the best dressed?//
+ Who is on unsteady ground?//
+ How could I get you to...?//
+ What do you worry might happen?//
+ How could I improve my connection with...?//

\section{Act against type}
Once per session, do or say something that goes against your friends expectations of you. 
On a 10+ pick 2 of 3. On a 7-9 pick 1.\\
All eyes are on you\\
Your words are heard\\
You escape lasting consequences\\

\section{Call their shit out}
When you need to, answer the questions and roll+1 for each yes. \\
> Did they just say something you overheard?\\
> Does it matter personally to you?\\
> Are you dressed fiercely?\\
On a 10+ pick 2. On a 7-9 pick 1.\\
+ You shame some and impress others\\
+ The shamed slink away\\
+ The impressed will, in the near future, make an introduction for you\\

\newpage

\section{Navigate Romance}
When you need to, answer the questions and roll+1 for each yes. \\
> if both people have clarified what they want, and the other person has repeated it back to them.\\
> if both people currently have no strained connections\\
> if they would both consider the setting romantic\\
On a 10+, choose 2. On a 7-9 choose 1. On a fail ask someone else to choose 1\\
+ A new and deeper understanding. +1 to that connection on your sheet\\
+ Really great sex\\
+ A compromise or conclusion is reached.\\

\section{Produce the goods}
When faced with an interesting career problem, gather your wits and roll.
On a 10+ choose 3 to protect. On a 7-9 choose 2. On a fail choose 1.\\
+ it doesn't take more time than expected, otherwise it does.\\
+ it doesn't cause complications in a relationship, otherwise it does\\
+ it doesn't leave you burnt out (-1 experience), otherwise it does\\
+ you smash it out of the park (+1 career), otherwise nothing\\

\section{Turn up the charm}
When you try to manipulate somebody into doing something using charm, wit or promises Roll.\\
On a 10+ they do what you want. If it's another player they mark experience.\\
On a 7-9 they do it, but they modify the terms or you owe them a favour. Take note.\\

\section{Ruminate on life}
When you ruminate on life, answer the questions and roll +1 for each yes:\\
> Are you in conversation with a wise soul?\\
> Are you relaxing the way you like to be? (spa, bar, jog ect)\\
> Do you currently have 2+ strained connections?\\
On a 10+ answer a GM question and clear all strains. On a 7-9 answer a GM question and clear 2 strains.\\
In both cases, when you clear the strain you may reduce that connection by 1.\\

\section{Learn from experience}
At the end of the session, or when appropriate in story answer questions and then Roll.\\
> Did you modify a connection? Mark XP\\
> Did you learn something new about yourself? Mark XP\\\
> Did you experiment romantically or sexually? Mark XP\\
On a 10+ remove 6xp and add +1 to any move on your character sheet.\\
On a 7-9 remove 7xp and add +1 to any move  you used this session.\\
